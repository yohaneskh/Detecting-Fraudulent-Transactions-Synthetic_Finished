# Detecting-Fraudulent-Transactions-Synthetic_Finished

This project analyzes a synthetic dataset generated by the **PaySim Mobile Money Simulator**, designed to emulate real-world financial transactions in a mobile money platform.

---

## 📊 Objective

To build a supervised **Machine Learning model** capable of identifying fraudulent transactions based on historical transaction data.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: PaySim (via Kaggle)
- **Size**: ~6 million rows (30-day simulation)
- **Each row**: Represents a single mobile money transaction.

### 🔑 Key Features:

- `step`: Time unit (1 hour per step), total 744 steps (30 days).
- `type`: Transaction types – CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, TRANSFER.
- `amount`: Transaction amount.
- `nameOrig` / `nameDest`: Sender and recipient IDs.
- `oldbalanceOrg` / `newbalanceOrig`: Sender's balance before and after.
- `oldbalanceDest` / `newbalanceDest`: Recipient's balance before and after.
- `isFraud`: Target label (1 = fraud, 0 = non-fraud).
- `isFlaggedFraud`: Flag if the transaction exceeds 200,000 units.

> ⚠️ Note:
> - Balance info is missing for merchants (IDs starting with 'M').
> - Fraudsters typically move money via TRANSFER followed by CASH-OUT.
> - Flagged frauds simulate detection of unusually large transfers.
