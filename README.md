# Detecting-Fraudulent-Transactions-Synthetic_Finished

This project analyzes a synthetic dataset generated by the **PaySim Mobile Money Simulator**, designed to emulate real-world financial transactions in a mobile money platform.

---

## A. Objective

To build a supervised **Machine Learning model** capable of identifying fraudulent transactions based on historical transaction data.

---

## B. Dataset Overview
- **Source**: PaySim (via Kaggle).
- **Size**: ~6 million rows (30-day simulation).
- **Each row**: Represents a single mobile money transaction.

---

## C. Tools & Technologies
- Python.
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `imbalanced-learn`, `Optuna`, `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`, and `CatBoost`.

---

## D. Models and Techniques

- **SMOTE**: Synthetic Minority Oversampling to handle class imbalance.
- **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, **CatBoost**: Gradient Boosting models.
- **Optuna**: Automated hyperparameter tuning.
- **Early Stopping & Pruning Callbacks**: For efficient model training.

---

## E. Evaluation Metrics

- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **AUC-ROC**
- **PR-AUC**

---

## F. How to Use This Notebook
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Mount your Google Drive:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
3. Update the path to the dataset: file_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Google Colab Notebooks/Data Analysis and AI Portfolio/Detecting Fraudulent Transactions (synthetic)/PS_201~1.CSV'
4. Run all cells and observe results for each Machine Learning model.

---

## G. Final Notes
- This notebook replicates the original Kaggle workflow but is adjusted to load the dataset via Google Drive, enabling hosting on GitHub.
- No model logic or metric calculation was modified and the results remain unchanged.
